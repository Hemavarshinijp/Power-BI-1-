"Power BI is an end-to-end enterprise business intelligence tool. It supports various layouts and connects with many data sources, offering flexibility in data presentation and analysis."
"Power Query functions as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) engine, enabling filtering, sorting, and the addition of new columns, which are essential for data manipulation."
Data Modeling in Power BI focuses on creating connections between tables, primarily involving two kinds of tables: Dimension (Primary) tables and Fact tables
"DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is the language used to create formulas in Power BI, while M-language is used for scripting in Power Query."
"Effective visuals, such as KPI cards and bar charts, combined with robust data modeling, are central to Power BIâ€™s capabilities in data analysis and reporting.
